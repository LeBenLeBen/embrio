## Setup

If you already have a WordPress instance working, clone or download the repository. If youâ€™re starting from scratch, I recommand you to use the [YeoPress](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress), the Yeoman WordPress generator.

Node.js with NPM are required to use Gulp and its plugins. Once youâ€™re ready, run the following command in the theme root folder:

```
npm install
```

While it downloads the Internets, edit the file `gulpfile.js` and change the BrowserSync `proxy` parameter to match the URL of your local WordPress installation.

Now that youâ€™re ready, run the following command to watch & reload the files:

```
npm start
```
